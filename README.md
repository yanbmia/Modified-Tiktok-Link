# Modified-Tiktok-Link

# Foobar

I deleted Tiktok, but my friends keep sending me Tiktoks. So I made this! 

Click the tiktok link your friend sends you and copy the link from the search engine. Note: this doesn't work if you press and copy the link. You need to click the tiktok link, once the link opens on your search engine, then copy that link. (Annoying I know, but this was a quick solution. Maybe I make another interation later.)
